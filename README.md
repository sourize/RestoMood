# Restaurant-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-Model
I developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to determine the sentiment of restaurant reviews, classifying them as either positive or negative. This project showcases my ability to handle text data, perform data preprocessing, and implement machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis.

  

**Key Steps and Methodologies:**

1.  **Dataset Preparation:**
    
    -   Utilized a Restaurant Review dataset containing various customer reviews.
        
    -   Performed extensive data cleaning to remove noise and ensure high-quality inputs.
        
2.  **Feature Extraction:**
    
    -   Applied the Bag of Words model to convert textual data into numerical features.
        
    -   This technique allowed for the transformation of text into a structured format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
        
3.  **Model Training:**
    
    -   Implemented the Naive Bayes algorithm, a popular choice for text classification tasks due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
        
    -   Trained the model using the extracted features from the Bag of Words representation.
        
4.  **Model Evaluation:**
    
    -   Achieved an accuracy of 73% on the test dataset, indicating a reliable performance in predicting the sentiment of restaurant reviews.
        
          
        

**Technologies and Tools:**

-   Python for programming.
    
-   Scikit-learn for machine learning and model implementation.
    
-   Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation and preprocessing.
    
      
    

**Outcome:**

The sentiment analysis model can accurately classify restaurant reviews as positive or negative, providing valuable insights for businesses to understand customer feedback. This project highlights my proficiency in NLP, data preprocessing, and the application of machine learning algorithms.
